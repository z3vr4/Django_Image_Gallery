# Django_Image_Gallery
PhotoApp
This project is basically a django app with login, image uploading and user profile functionality (not yet implemented) I'm building for practice.
Currently in development, so really incomplete at the moment.

Installation:
- Django project still in development, not applicable. Will update later.

Usage:
- Django project still in development, not applicable. Will update later. Its (supposed) to be a user friendly web app, where they can create profiles, and share pictures.

Provide information on how users can use your project. Include code snippets, examples, and any relevant details.

Acknowledgements:
- Chatgpt (wrote most of the html / css, I mainly focused on the technical aspects of this app, not the visuals)
