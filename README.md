# Django_Image_Gallery
## PhotoApp
This project is basically a django app with login, image uploading and user profile functionality I'm building for practice.
Currently in development, so really incomplete at the moment, UX not polished.

# Current project status:
### Main Project Setup:
- ✔️ Create main project folder and files
- ✔️ Create main project app
- ✔️ Initialize Git for version control

### HTML/CSS Templates Creation:
- ✔️ Document the process
- ✔️ Review and adjustments completed

### Model Planning:
- ✔️ Define models for User, Image, and UserProfile
- ✔️ User authentication model planning
- ✔️ Register models with Django Admin

### HTML/CSS Review and Refurbish:
- ✔️ Looks decent enough. Will probably implement bootstrap or whatever in the future.

### User Login Functionality:
- ✔️ Initial login functionality
- ✔️ Testing completed

### User Image Uploading Functionality:
- ✔️ Initial uploading functionality
- ✔️ Testing completed

### Image Submission Detail View:
- ✔️ Build submission detail view
- ✔️ Testing completed

### HTML/CSS for Main Landing Page:
- ✔️ Done. Will improve it in the future.

### Comment Functionality for Image Detail Views:
- ✔️ Build basic comment functionality
- ✔️ Testing completed
- ✔️ Isn't blindingly ugly anymore.
  
### Edit Profile and Image Submission Functionality
- In development, currently set up the view and url paths to build the functionality on top of it.

### Model reconfiguration, search functionality
- TBD later

### Main Testing, Polishing, Reassess Project Status:
- This is a constant step
- Maybe implement a pagination feature or a search functionality some time in the future.



# Installation:
- Django project still in development, not applicable. Will update later.

# Usage:
- Django project still in development, not applicable. Will update later. Its (supposed) to be a user friendly web app, where they can create profiles, and share pictures.

# Acknowledgements:
- Chatgpt (wrote most of the html / css, I mainly focused on the technical aspects of this app, not the visuals)
- freeCodeCamp (most of the CSS for the image grid display I got from the mini project in the HTML/CSS course, remodeled a bit to work with the django setup)
